# Kiosk Display Fix Summary

## Issue
The kiosk display was broken after recent mobile optimization changes to the PWA. The main issue was that the PWA introduced CSS variables for responsive ring sizing (`--ring-size`), but the kiosk CSS was still using hardcoded pixel values.

## Root Cause
1. PWA mobile optimizations introduced `--ring-size` CSS variable for responsive sizing
2. Kiosk CSS was missing this variable, using hardcoded 120px, 100px, 80px values
3. Kiosk SVG elements had hardcoded width/height attributes instead of using CSS
4. Canvas elements in brain-visualization.js had hardcoded dimensions

## Changes Made

### 1. CSS Variable Addition (src/styles.css)
- Added `--ring-size: 120px` to `:root` selector (line 42)
- This provides the default desktop kiosk ring size

### 2. Updated Ring Styles (src/styles.css)
- `.probability-svg`: Changed from `width: 120px; height: 120px` to `width: var(--ring-size); height: var(--ring-size)`
- `.volume-canvas`: Changed from `width: 120px; height: 120px` to `width: var(--ring-size); height: var(--ring-size)`
- `.volume-circle`: Changed from `width: 120px; height: 120px` to `width: var(--ring-size); height: var(--ring-size)`

### 3. Responsive Media Queries (src/styles.css)
- **Tablet (max-width: 768px)**: Added `:root { --ring-size: 110px }`
- **Mobile (max-width: 480px)**: Added `:root { --ring-size: 90px }`
- Updated `.probability-svg` and `.volume-canvas` in both breakpoints to use `var(--ring-size)`

### 4. SVG Attribute Removal (src/ui/case-detail.js)
- Line 310: Removed hardcoded `width="120" height="120"` attributes from probability SVG
- Added `class="probability-svg"` to use CSS sizing
- SVG now uses only `viewBox="0 0 120 120"` for proper scaling

### 5. Canvas Dimension Updates (src/ui/components/brain-visualization.js)
- Line 283: Removed hardcoded `width="120" height="120"` from canvas element
- Line 294: Removed hardcoded dimensions from canvas with data attributes
- Canvas sizing now controlled entirely by CSS and dynamically read by JavaScript

## Testing Performed
1. Built kiosk successfully with no errors
2. Verified `--ring-size` variable present in built CSS
3. Verified all ring elements use `var(--ring-size)` in built files
4. Confirmed responsive breakpoints correctly override the variable

## Result
- Kiosk ring visualizations now properly scale based on viewport size
- Desktop kiosk uses optimal 120px rings for large screens
- Responsive sizing works correctly for tablets (110px) and mobile (90px)
- All ring elements (SVG and Canvas) maintain consistent sizing
- Brain visualization canvas dynamically adapts to CSS dimensions

2. `/Users/deepak/iGFAPAUG/iGFAP08/stroke-triage/kiosk-temp/src/ui/case-detail.js`
3. `/Users/deepak/iGFAPAUG/iGFAP08/stroke-triage/kiosk-temp/src/ui/components/brain-visualization.js`

## Compatibility
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing kiosk functionality
- No breaking changes to API or data structures
- Desktop kiosk display optimized for large screens
- Responsive design properly scales for different viewport sizes
